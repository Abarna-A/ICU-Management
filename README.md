# ICU-Management

**Problem Statement:**
Managing mechanical ventilation in the ICU is a high-stakes balancing act. Clinicians must constantly adjust ventilator setting such as oxygen concentration and airway pressure  based on a flood of patient data, including blood oxygen levels (SpO₂), carbon dioxide (PaCO₂), and respiratory rate. 
However, relying on generalized protocols often leads to suboptimal care because patients respond differently based on their condition (e.g., COVID-19 vs. pneumonia). 
The Dutch ICU Data Warehouse study highlighted this issue, revealing that 44% of AI-derived ventilation policies failed when tested under different clinical scenarios. This underscores the need for an adaptive, AI-driven system that can personalize treatment while ensuring safety.
